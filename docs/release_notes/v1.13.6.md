## Fix Duplicate AWS Auth Field in Postgresql

### Problem

When selecting "AWS: Access Key ID and Secret Access Key" as the authentication profile for PostgreSQL, multiple fields for "AWS AccessKey, AWS Region, and AWS Secret Key" appear.

### Impact

Dapr would throw an error for duplicate metadata field.

### Root cause

During the build process, the built-in authentication profile was appended unnecessarily, leading to these redundant fields.

### Solution

The build logic was modified to eliminate this redundancy, preventing the duplication of metadata fields.
